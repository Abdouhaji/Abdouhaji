### Hi there 👋

Hello everyone! My name is Abdou Haji and I am currently enrolled in the Codecademy career path as a Data Scientist, specializing in analytics. 

I am excited to share with you my latest project, titled "Watching Stocks Project." In this project, I have utilized SQL to analyze and extract valuable information from a dataset related to stock market data. By leveraging SQL queries and techniques, the goal is to show how to uncover patterns, trends, and correlations within the stock market data.

Your input and suggestions will greatly contribute to the refinement and improvement of my analysis. Thank you in advance for taking the time to review my work!

Please feel free to ask any questions or share your thoughts on the "Watching Stocks Project."
